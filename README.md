## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3*. WordCloud is to consider if not install on your machine.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using IMDB 5000 movies to better understand:

1. How are correlated facebook likes and movie popularity ?
2. What about content rating and genres of top 200 movies with most facebook likes?
3. Propose a wordcloud with top popular movies name
4. Machine learning technique to check feature importance related to imdb score


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. This notebook come from Manos Pratikakis found under Kaggle.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@vnauton/how-data-sciences-can-help-you-decide-witch-movie-to-watch-tonight-d2f363c70895?sk=574180b58ac2c882e872a69d90a0b017).
